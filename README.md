# Firebase-React-Vite-ts

This project is for testing firebase and Mui

Currently I have :

Auth : sign in, sign up, sign with provider, forgot password

When user log in for the first the user is added to firestore database.

User can post with title, description, tags... the photo is stored inside firebase storage
